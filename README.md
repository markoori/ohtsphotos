# This project is a slideshow created for use for as many images as you have, it doesn't matter the number. The only drawback is that you have to set the "auto" in the "grid-template-column" on the css to as many images as you have. The javascript is okay, you can change the filename, or just make sure that your files are named in this format " download(1)" to download(what ever number).
